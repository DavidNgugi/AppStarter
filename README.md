### Steps in Starting an App
1. Provide the name of the Project Folder
2. Input I, L, N or P to choose the type of app (Ionic[I], Laravel[L], NodeJs[N], Python[P])
3. If the app is an NodeJs or Python app, input the starter file (Init file). i.e hello.py, run.py, server.js, run.js, app.js or WHATEVER STARTER FILE YOU HAVE!
4. THAT'S IT FOLKS! YOUR APP WILL NOW BEGIN UNLESS YOU MADE A TYPO!
